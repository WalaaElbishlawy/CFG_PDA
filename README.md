# PDA & CFG Problems Solver

## Overview
This project contains solutions to various problems involving Pushdown Automata (PDA) and Context-Free Grammars (CFG) using Java. The project is structured to handle input from text files and produce the corresponding output in a specified format.

## Requirements

### CFG Problems
1. **Equal number of a's and b's**:
   - Write a CFG that accepts an equal number of `a`'s and `b`'s.
   
2. **Number of a's is twice the number of b's**:
   - Write a CFG that accepts strings where the number of `a`'s is twice the number of `b`'s.
   
3. **Palindrome over Î£ = {a,b}**:
   - Write a CFG that accepts palindromes over the alphabet `{a, b}`.
   
4. **Language {a^(2n+3) b^n | n>=0}**:
   - Write a CFG that accepts the language `{a^(2n+3) b^n | n >= 0}`.

### PDA Problems
For each PDA problem, submit:
- The drawn PDA diagram.
- The Java code that solves the problem.

## Program Input/Output
- The Java program takes a single input text file containing the input values for each problem.
- The program must save the output of each problem in a single output text file following the required format for each problem.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the Java source code for solving PDA and CFG problems.
- **input_cfg.txt**: Input file containing the CFG problem inputs.
- **input_pda.txt**: Input file containing the PDA problem inputs.
- **output_cfg.txt**: Output file containing the CFG problem outputs.
- **output_pda.txt**: Output file containing the PDA problem outputs.
- **CFG Rules**: Contains the CFG rules for each CFG problem.
- **PDA Diagrams**: Contains the drawn PDA diagrams for each PDA problem.
